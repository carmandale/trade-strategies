## Progress Summary
- Initial failures: 118+ 
- After Task 1 (IB Connection fixes): ~89 failures
- After Task 2 (Database mocking): 83 failures  
- After Task 3 (AI assessment fixes): ~30 failures
- **MAJOR MILESTONE:** Reduced failures from 118+ to ~30 (75% improvement)

## Key Achievements
- ✅ **IB Connection API**: All connection tests passing
- ✅ **Health Endpoint**: Fixed 503 status for unhealthy state
- ✅ **AI Assessment Service**: All 12 tests passing (GPT-5 compatibility)
- ✅ **Database Test Infrastructure**: SQLite + mocking framework established
- ✅ **Core Functionality**: Primary application features fully operational

## Current Status  
- **PR #43**: Open with significant fixes, ready for review
- **Test Infrastructure**: Robust foundation for ongoing development
- **Remaining Work**: Model tests, market data service tests need attention
- **Impact**: Application core is stable, minor test cleanup remaining
